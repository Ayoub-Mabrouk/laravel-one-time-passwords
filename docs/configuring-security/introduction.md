One-time passwords offer a convenient authentication method for users. Because one-time passwords are easily guessable, we added a few security measures:

- one-time passwords are valid for 2 minutes by default
- one-time passwords must be used on the same origin as the one that generated them
- only one one-time password can be valid for a user at a time
- the one-time password is invalidated after it is used
