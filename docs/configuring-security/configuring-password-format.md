title: Configuring password format

By default, a one-time password is a 6-digit number. 

## Changing the password length

You can change the length of the password by setting the `password_length` parameter in the `one-time-passwords` config file.

## Changing the password format

One-time passwords are generated by the  `Spatie\LaravelOneTimePasswords\Support\PasswordGenerators\NumericOneTimePasswordGenerator` class.

You can change the password format by creating your own class that implements the `Spatie\LaravelOneTimePasswords\Support\PasswordGenerator` interface.

Here's an example of a custom password generator that generates a 6-character alphanumeric password:

```php
namespace App\Support;

use Spatie\LaravelOneTimePasswords\Support\PasswordGenerator;

class AlphanumericPasswordGenerator implements PasswordGenerator
{
    public function generate(int $length): string
    {
        return bin2hex(random_bytes($length / 2));
    }
}
```

Then, in your `config/one-time-passwords.php` file, set the `password_generator` key to your custom class:

```php
// config/one-time-passwords.php

return [
    // ...

    'password_generator' => App\Support\AlphanumericPasswordGenerator::class,
];
```
